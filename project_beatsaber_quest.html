                    Beat Saber is a music/rythm game where you slash blocks with light-sabers to the beat of a song.
                    Modding is a big part of the game and it would not be the same without it. 
                    With mods you can add your own music to the game, customize the game looks, etc.

                    Oculus Quest 2 is a standalone VR headset that uses Snapdragon XR2 processor. 
                    It is a powerful SoC with CPU 6x 1.8GHz and 2x 2.5GHz cores and GPU at 587MHz with up to 1267 GFlops performance. 
                    However, due to lack of efficient cooling the cpu cores are limited to 1.5GHz and 1.9GHz.

                <p style = "text-indent:1cm;">
                    The game itself is built on Unity game engine using C# but due to hardware limitation the Quest version of the game
                    is compiled with IL2CPP(Intermediate Language To C++) meaning that the mods "have" be created in C++.
                    The modding tools are created and maintained by modders community.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Basic principle behind modding is that 
                    original function calls are interrupted by your custom code, 
                    either before or after the original function call.
                    When choosing a method to hook, it is important to know what the function does.
                    Unfortunately, this information is not available. 
                    On the PC version of the game, we can luckily use a tool called
                     <a class="hyperLink_inText" href="https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy">dnSpy</a>.
                    It is a powerful tool for .NET programs.
                    This tool allows to find exact line-by-line definition of function/method.
                    Luckily, in the Quest version of the game the functions are mostly the same.
                    However, due to IL2CPP some of the original sources get stripped away.
                    This means that not all of the functionality of Unity game engine is available.

                <h2>Latest mod</h2>
                <p style = "text-indent:1cm;">
                    In this mod I used Oculus Quest hand-tracking API to 
                    set the position of the saber to the tips of your fingers.
                
                    The game world is shrinked down to accommodate for smaller saber movement,
                    making it essentially a minature version of the game.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Using hand-tracking API meant that I had to find a way 
                    to initialize hand-tracking API from code.

                    I decided to first create a new Unity project 
                    to understand how the hand-tracking API is working.
                    On the Unity project, using C#, the hands were
                    initialized essentially automatically. 

                    Once I understood how the hand-tracking API works, I started to create a mod.
                    It took me a while to figure out that I had to manually call certain 
                    initialization functions in order to get the hand-tracking API working.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    The biggest issue that I faced was memory leak that I could not explain. 
                    This is to be expected when making unofficial mods for a game
                    where the tools are not very mature nor well documented. 

                    The memory leak issue was caused by hand-tracking container. 
                    This container was simply an Unity gameObject that contained all neccecary 
                    gameObjects and scripts. 

                    In Unity you can set a gameObjects to persist through the changes of scenes.
                    For some reason hand-tracking container did no properly persist through the scene changes.
                    
                    My solution to this was to delete the hand-tracking container 
                    before scene changed and re-create it when a scene is loaded.

                <p style = "text-indent:1cm;">
                    In this mod the sabers are attached to rope. 
                    The rope is simulated using Verlet integration, and it is highly customizable. 
                    By changing parameters its possible to make rope more 
                    elastic or more rigid, longer or shorter, etc.
                </p>

                    <!-- 
                        In Verlet integration the rope is simulated by moving the rope nodes
                        by changing their position with respect to the forces acting on them. 
                        At this point the nodes "do not see" other nodes.

                    In Verlet integration the rope is simulated by moving the rope nodes
                    with respect to the forces acting on them. 
                    At this point the nodes do not interact with each other.

                    After this, constraints are applied multiple times (10-100 times). 
                    Each time rope points are moved slighlty to fit their constraints, 
                    i.e., the rope is "stretched" or "compressed"
                    to fit the length constraint.
