                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a list of games I have made using Unity.
                    Note that none of the games are actually fully finished.
                </p>

                <h1 id="SubLabel">VR Physics Skateboarding</h1>
                <p>
                    Main idea behind this project was to see if and how well would 
                    physics based skateboarding work, since hands act as feet.
                    To my surprise it worked quite well. 
                    Few things that I would like to improve:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Hands (feet) going through physical objects 
                            when physical hands go too far into objects.
                            This could be done by reducing the force of the feet
                            towards the normal of current collision surface,
                            when feet are currently colliding.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add a system that allows player to actually roll 
                            and turn on the skateboard.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h2>Proof of concept</h2>
                
                <p style = "text-indent:1cm;">
                    Skateboarding with hands as feet. Every object is physics based 
                    or in Unity terms has a RigidBody component on it.
                    This raises a problem of how should feet should follow the physical hands. 
                    Essentially shoes/feet are trying to achieve the vr-controllers Transform by applying force themselves. 
                    This means that shoes act as pure physics objects and will collide with any other Collider.

                <p>
                    Local multiplayer (single screen) stickman fighting game made with Unity.
                    Featuring:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Physics based characters. All of the joints have PID-controller that adds force
                            such that the joints will reach their target rotation.
                            This allows physics based animations (running/walking/standing) and hand movement.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Multiple players, 1 with keyboard-and-mouse and technically unlimited gamepad players.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Customizeable looks (skin, hair). Easy to add new skins and hair.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Different weapons such as swords, handguns, automatic rifles, granades, etc.

                <h1 id="SubLabel">MediaPipe Hand tracking</h1>

                <p style>
                    In this project I made a hand tracking application using 
                    <a class="hyperLink_inText" href="https://google.github.io/mediapipe/">MediaPipe</a>.
                    MediaPipe is google's open source project that enables
                    camera based tracking using machine learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    MediaPipe is natively available for C++ and Python. As Unity uses C# I had to 
                    come up with a way to use it in Unity.
                    Unity supports a feature called Native plug-ins that allows to call library functions 
                    created in C/C++ and objective-c, from C#.
                    However I did not this route and instead chose to use the API in Python,
                    and send the results over to C#, as it was the quickest way to get it working.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using MediaPipe in python I was able to track finger joint locations in 3D space.
                    The results were combined into ordered set of floats, 
                    that were sent to Unity over TCP socket, in binary format. 
                    The floats were in groups of three, representing the x,y,z coordinates of the joint.
                    On the Unity side further processing was done in order to get joint rotations. 
                    This was done by calculating palm normal and using that 
                    as basis for other joint rotation calculations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the Python side I set up two threads, one running the MediaPipe's hand-tracking 
                    and another for sending the results over to Unity. Using two threads speed up the
                    overall tracking process. The limiting factor was in fact the ML model,
                    as opposed to communication or camera speed. Im also guessing that using c-based language
                    would not speed up the ML model forward pass, because ML API's,
                    including tensorflow, are using c-based language as backend anyway.
                    What would speed up the forward pass would be to use GPU version of the API.
                </p>
